## Planning

Right now a lot of the planning for this project takes place in our development Discord, or through GitHub Issues and Projects.
We're working on ways to improve the planning structure and better solicit feedback, and if you feel like you can help in this respect, feel free to give us a holler.

## Documentation

The documentation for this repository is available at [`glitch-soc/docs`](https://github.com/glitch-soc/docs) (online at [glitch-soc.github.io/docs/](https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/)).
Right now, we've mostly focused on the features that make this fork different from upstream in some manner.
Adding screenshots, improving descriptions, and so forth are all ways to help contribute to the project even if you don't know any code.

## Pull Requests

### Size and Scope

Our time is limited and PRs making large, unsolicited changes are unlikely to
get a response. Changes which link to an existing confirmed issue, or which come
from a "help wanted" issue or other request are more likely to be reviewed.

The smaller and more narrowly focused the changes in a PR are, the easier they
are to review and potentially merge. If the change only makes sense in some
larger context of future ongoing work, note that in the description, but still
aim to keep each distinct PR to a "smallest viable change" chunk of work.

### Description of Changes

Unless the Pull Request is about refactoring code, updating dependencies or
other internal tasks, assume that the audience are not developers, but a
Mastodon user or server admin, and try to describe it from their perspective.

The final commit in the main branch will carry the title from the PR. The main
branch is then fed into the changelog and ultimately into release notes. We try
to follow the [keepachangelog] spec, and while that does not prescribe how
exactly the entries ought to be named, starting titles using one of the verbs
"Add", "Change", "Deprecate", "Remove", or "Fix" (present tense) is helpful.

Example:

| Not ideal                            | Better                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fixed NoMethodError in RemovalWorker | Fix nil error when removing statuses caused by race condition |

### Technical Requirements

Pull requests that do not pass automated checks on CI may not be reviewed. In
particular, please keep in mind:

- Unit and integration tests (rspec, jest)
- Code style rules (rubocop, eslint)
- Normalization of locale files (i18n-tasks)
- Relevant accessibility or performance concerns

## Documentation

The [Mastodon documentation] is a statically generated site that contains guides
and API docs. Improvements are made via PRs to the [documentation repository].
